B1:
    - the innermost subselect (sales) calculates the amount of sold units per Product ID
        and sorts the results per TopCategory and Sales
    - the first subselect (ranked) calculates the ranking of sold units per Product ID
        (most sold Product has rank 1, etc.)
        this is done via variables, because mysql has no easier ROW_NUMBER() function
    - then, only those Products are considered whose ranking is <= 3
        (top 3 sold per TopCategory)

C1:
    - the Query was written in SQL since the required ShipmentMethod information does not appear in
        the OLAP cube as defined in the assignment PDF

D1:
    - [OrderDate].[2014].[1]:[OrderDate].[2014].[7] takes a sequence from the year 2014 over months 1 - 7
        (January 2014 through July 2014)
        -> [OrderDate].[2014].[1]:[7] did not work
        -> apparently the Month can be accessed directly after accessing the Year (since they're defined
            directly after each other in the hierarchy?)
    - OrderDate was assumed to be the point of time relevant for the calculation of TaxAmount
